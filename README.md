## Comments on playability in 4v4 CTFPUG (warning: opinion)

This is purely based on layout, weapon placements, spawns, routes, etc. Some of these are butt ugly because I put little to no effort into the aesthetics but the rest of them are fine.

**Definitely enjoyable/playable (improvements would be minimal or none):**

- mp/ctf_homon
- mp/ctf_kadavo
- mp/ctf_orion
- mp/ctf_sertao

**Likely enjoyable/playable (little or no actual gameplay tests done):**

- mp/ctf_molavar_pub - this one is unique because it was played MANY times on ja+ and actually quite fun, but I'm not sure it was ever pugged
- mp/ctf_nsgf
- mp/ctf_quanton

**Could possibly--if not likely--be playable/enjoyable with improvements:**

- mp/ctf_bryndar
- mp/ctf_erkit
- mp/ctf_frisal
- mp/ctf_generis
- mp/ctf_iskalon
- mp/ctf_jodaka
- mp/ctf_lazerian
- mp/ctf_radnor

**Probably don't bother:**

- mp/ctf_ambria
- mp/ctf_chazwa
- mp/ctf_delaya (too big for 4s, but could potentially be fun in 5s I think)
